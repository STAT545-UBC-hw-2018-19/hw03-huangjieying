# hw03-Use dplyr/ggplot2 to manipulate and explore data

This is my repo for Stat 545 A Homework03: Use dplyr/ggplot2 to manipulate and explore data 
The goal is to manipulate and explore a dataset with the dplyr package, complemented by visualizations made with ggplot2.

## Task list

The 5 tasks I chose to explore is listed as following:
* Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

* Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

* Compute a weighted mean (weighting by population) of life expectancy for different years.

* How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?

* Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent.
